# QUESTRADE

This is a library for interfacing with [Questrade](https://www.questrade.com), an online broker located in Canada.  Currently Questrade is back to accepting read-only operations for their API, making this library mostly useful for data gathering.  For more details read the the [Questrade API documentation](https://www.questrade.com/api), as this library provides a light wraper.
